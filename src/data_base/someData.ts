	The 51% attack remains a concern, as if a large group controlling 51% of the system's power wishes to make changes, they gain the ability to confirm new data due to their majority user representation.Hello!
	Let's talk about blockchain and answer the question: "What is blockchain?"
	
	Is blockchain Bitcoin?
	Many people associate blockchain with cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. They are partly correct. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency built on blockchain technology.
	
	So, what is blockchain?
	Blockchain is an advanced database mechanism where data is stored in blocks that are linked together in a chain. Each subsequent block contains information about the previous one. It's impossible to change information in one block without affecting others. Additionally, these blocks are stored on numerous computers, making it physically impossible to change data on all computers at once.
	
	Where can this technology be used?
	
	- Energy: Creating a platform for selling excess energy generated by individuals.
	
	- Finance: there are Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. And blockchain can increase the reliability of financial institutions.
	
	- Multimedia: Protecting copyrights.
	
	- Trade: Tracking the movement and authenticity of goods.
	
	- Healthcare: Tracking supply chains for medicines and their quality.
	
	- Voting: Preventing voter fraud.
	
	What are the capabilities of blockchain?
	
	- Decentralization: Decision-making control and data integrity are distributed among many users, reducing the potential for manipulation.
	- Immutability: Once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted.
	- Consensus:  verify transactions based on predefined rules, and a majority must confirm a transaction.
	
	How does blockchain work?
	
	- Recording transactions: A specific event containing predefined data is recorded.
	- Reaching consensus: A majority of participants must confirm the validity of the recorded transaction.
	- Combining blocks: All records are combined into a block and added with a cryptographic hash. It’s help to track changes.
	- Sharing the ledger: The system distributes the final copy of the ledger among all participants.
	
	Types of blockchain networks:
	
	- Public: Anyone can join the existing network.
	- Private: Controlled by a single organization that determines who can join.
	- Hybrid: Allows controlling access to certain data while keeping other data accessible to all, suitable for banks and financial institutions.
	- Consortium: Controlled by a group of companies involved in a common activity and using the network in their interactions.
	
	When did blockchain emerge?
	
	- 1970s: Ralph Merkle patented the concept of a hash tree.
	- 1990s: Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta created a system that prevented tampering with document timestamps.
